Pallavi Tools Documentation
===============================

Tools section of the Pallavi project contains various tools for making Malayalam
language model for Automated Speech Recognition easier. Tool set is primarily
for creating the language model. For creating accoustic models, the modelling
tools that comes with the ASR library shall be used (Julius, CMU Sphinx etc).

Building from Source
===============================
Once the source code is downloaded and extracted, use the following commands to
setup the initial configure scripts.
$ ./bootstrap
And then the usual
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Once bootstrap script is run, refer INSTALL file for detailed instructions and
options available with ./configure

Utilities Included
===============================

pallavi_ml2p
-------------------------------
This program is used for converting the text in UTF-8 encoded Malayalam language
to phones based text. This is basically a transliteration and maps text in to 
phones. The resulting files would have an extension .trans and contains words
transliterated from the input text files on which a transliteration was 
applicable. Non Malayalam words in input files would be ignored.

Usage: pallavi_ml2p <infile1> [infile2] ..

Atleast one input text file should be provided. A number of file names can also
be provided for transliteration. If the input file name is input1, input2 etc,
corresponding transliterated files would be named as input1.trans and 
input2.trans. 

Eg: pallavi_ml2p text1.txt text2.txt 
    pallavi_ml2p * (For all the files in current directory)
    
A help message would be displayed if the program is run with no arguments.

pallavi_mltxt2wordlist
--------------------------
This program is for converting the transliterated word files in to a word list
file that can be used for the next step, which is creating a dictionary. A list
of all unique words in all the input files would be crated and dumped to a 
specified/default output file. The .trans files created by pallavi_ml2p would
be the recommended input for pallavi_mltxt2wordlist. 

Usage: pallavi_mltxt2wordlist <infile1> [infile2] .. [-o/--output outfile]

Atleast one input file must be provided. An output file can be specified using
-o or --output option. If no output file name is specified, a default filename
words.list would be created in the current directory.

Eg: pallavi_mltxt2wordlist text1.trans text2.trans --output words.list
    pallavi_mltxt2wordlist *.trans -o words.list
    pallavi_mltxt2wordlist *.trans

A help message would be displayed if the program is run with no arguments.

pallavi_mldictgen
--------------------------
This program is for generating a dictionary file from a word list file generated
by pallavi_mltxt2wordlist. This dictionary file will be used by the ASR libs
for translating speech to words.

Usage: pallavi_mldictgen --wordlist(-w) <word list> --dict(-d) <dict file>

An input wordlist file must be specified with --wordlist or -w option. Output
file name should be specified by --dict or -d option. Both these arguments are 
mandatory.

Eg: pallavi_mldictgen --wordlist words.list --dict words.dic

A help message would be displayed if the program is run with incorrect number or
wrong arguments.

Language Dictionary Generation
===============================
Collect a lot of Malayalam text that would contain many different words. One 
file or many files with a recommended .txt extension. Keep the files in a single
directory and run

$ pallavi_ml2p *.txt

This will generate a .trans file for each ,txt file. Now run,

$ pallavi_mltxt2wordlist *.trans

This will generate a default output word list in default output file words.list

$ pallavi_mldictgen -w words.list -d words.dic

words.dic file now contains a dictionary file to be used with ASR libraries. Use
$ wc -l words.list 
to find out the number of words in the dictionary.
