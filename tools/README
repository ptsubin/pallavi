Utilities Included
===============================

pallavi_ml2p
-------------------------------
This program is used for converting the text in UTF-8 encoded Malayalam language
to phones based text. This is basically a transliteration and maps text in to 
phones. The resulting files would have an extension .trans and contains words
transliterated from the input text files on which a transliteration was 
applicable. Non Malayalam words in input files would be ignored.

Usage: pallavi_ml2p <infile1> [infile2] ..

Atleast one input text file should be provided. A number of file names can also
be provided for transliteration. If the input file name is input1, input2 etc,
corresponding transliterated files would be named as input1.trans and 
input2.trans. 

Eg: pallavi_ml2p text1.txt text2.txt 
    pallavi_ml2p * (For all the files in current directory)
    
A help message would be displayed if the program is run with no arguments.

pallavi_mltxt2wordlist
--------------------------
This program is for converting the transliterated word files in to a word list
file that can be used for the next step, which is creating a dictionary. A list
of all unique words in all the input files would be crated and dumped to a 
specified/default output file. The .trans files created by pallavi_ml2p would
be the recommended input for pallavi_mltxt2wordlist. 

Usage: pallavi_mltxt2wordlist <infile1> [infile2] .. [-o/--output outfile]

Atleast one input file must be provided. An output file can be specified using
-o or --output option. If no output file name is specified, a default filename
words.list would be created in the current directory.

Eg: pallavi_mltxt2wordlist text1.trans text2.trans --output words.list
    pallavi_mltxt2wordlist *.trans -o words.list
    pallavi_mltxt2wordlist *.trans

A help message would be displayed if the program is run with no arguments.
